# Simple Data Pipe connector for [Runkeeper](https://runkeeper.com/developer/healthgraph/)

This connector uses the [Runkeeper Health Graph API](https://runkeeper.com/developer/healthgraph/) to fetch the following data from your Runkeeper account:

 * Profile
 * Settings
 * Friends
 * Personal Records
 * Strength Training Activities
 * Fitness Activities
 * Background Activities
 * Weight Measurements
 * Sleep Measurements
 * Nutritional Measurements
 * Diabetes Measurements
 * General Measurements
 * Change Log

The [Simple Data Pipe SDK](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/simple-data-pipe-sdk) is used to store the data in Cloudant. Depending on the data type one or more JSON records are created and stored in Cloudant. Here are some sample JSON records:

##### Message record structure for Profile:
```json
{
 "..." : "<cloudant document properties such as _id and _rev>",
 "elite": "false",
 "profile": "https://runkeeper.com/user/XXXXXXXXXX",
 "name": "<FirstName LastName>",
 "pt_type": "profile"
}
```

##### Message record structure for a single Fitness Activity:
```json
{
 "..." : "<cloudant document properties such as _id and _rev>",
 "utc_offset": -5,
 "duration": 999.99,
 "start_time": "Tue, 22 Mar 2016 06:34:36",
 "total_calories": 250,
 "tracking_mode": "outdoor",
 "total_distance": 2937.4032807311162,
 "entry_mode": "API",
 "has_path": true,
 "source": "Runkeeper",
 "type": "Running",
 "uri": "/fitnessActivities/XXXXXXXXX",
 "pt_type": "fitness_activities"
}
```

For more information regarding each data type, see the [Runkeeper Health Graph API](https://runkeeper.com/developer/healthgraph/).
