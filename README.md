# Simple Data Pipe connector for [RunKeeper](https://runkeeper.com/developer/healthgraph/)

This [Simple Data Pipe](https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/simple-data-pipe/) connector for RunKeeper starter kit has been customized for [RunKeeper Health Graph](https://runkeeper.com/developer/healthgraph/) OAuth access. You can build your own special purpose connector by implementing the `getRunKeeperDataSetList` and `fetchRecords` functions in `lib/index.js` to fetch the desired data from RunKeeper and optionally enrich it.
### Pre-requisites

##### General 
 A valid RunKeeper account is required to use this connector.

##### Deploy the Simple Data Pipe

 [Deploy the Simple Data Pipe in Bluemix](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/simple-data-pipe) using the Deploy to Bluemix button or manually.

##### Services

This connector does not require any additional Bluemix service.


##### Install the Simple Data Pipe connector for RunKeeper

  When you [follow these steps to install this connector](https://github.com/ibm-cds-labs/simple-data-pipe/wiki/Installing-a-Simple-Data-Pipe-Connector), add the following line to the dependencies list in the `package.json` file:
